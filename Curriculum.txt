Modular Coding Course Curriculum.
The is course is designed heavily on ability of software to work cross platform, due to this majority of the course will be conducted on UNIX/UNIX-LIKE (LINUX) OS. Also knowing that commonly used and available OS is Windows, the course will provide the necessary tools and approach.
Major Topic
•	Mastery Over the Command Line.
•	Git and GitHub. 
•	GNU Make.
•	Cmake.
•	Basic of C and C++.
•	DSA (Data structure and algorithm’s) in C++ and More to come…


This Course will also have groups of individual working together on project provide throughout the curriculum, As well as Individual projects depending on the skills of the respective Individual.
