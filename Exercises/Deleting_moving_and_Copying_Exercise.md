# Deleting, Moving & Copying Exercise

## Part 1: Creating The Folders & Files

Before we can delete, move, or copy things...we need things! It's time to get some more practice using `touch` and `mkdir`

Please create a new directory somewhere on your machine called `Bootcamp`.  Inside of it, create the the folders and files indicated below:

```bash
**Bootcamp/**
	**FallCohort/**
		Italo.txt
		Edgar.txt
		Linus.txt
		Sara.txt 
		Silvio.txt
		**Waitlist/**
			Hanna.txt
			Haris.txt
			Netta.txt
	**WinterCohort/**
		Santiago.txt
		Iris.txt
		Naomi.txt
```

- Sadly `Edgar` had to drop out of the course.  Delete the `Edgar.txt` file in `FallCohort`
- This means we now have space in our Fall Cohort to move someone off of the waitlist.  Please move `Netta.txt` from the `Waitlist` folder into the `FallCohort` folder.
- Please delete the `Waitlist` folder and its contents
- It turns out that I misspelled Sara.  She spells her name "Sarah" with an "h" at the end.  Please rename the `Sara.txt` file to `Sarah.txt`
- Unfortunately Italo is having a bit of a personal emergency, and he would like to move to our WinterCohort.  Please move the `Italo.txt` file from `FallCohort` to the `WinterCohort` folder
- Oh no, our entire Winter Cohort had to be cancelled because of a worldwide pandemic :(   We decided to bump all of the scheduled winter students to spring. In the `Bootcamp` directory create a copy of the `WinterCohort` folder called `SpringCohort`
- Please rename the WinterCohort folder to `WinterCohortCANCELLED`
- Oh no! We're going out of business. Please delete the entire `Bootcamp` directory ðŸ˜¢
